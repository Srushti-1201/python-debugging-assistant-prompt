# Python Screening Task 2

This repository contains the prompt and reasoning for an AI Debugging Assistant designed to help students debug Python code through guided, non-revealing hints.

# Python Screening Task 2 ‚Äì AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

## üìå Prompt
See `prompt.md` for the exact AI prompt text.

## üéØ Design Choices
- **Encouraging Learning, Not Giving Answers**  
  The wording explicitly instructs the AI to guide rather than solve directly. This approach fosters active learning and critical thinking in students.

- **Clear Structure**  
  Numbered, precise instructions ensure the AI consistently focuses on analysis, hints, and non-revealing feedback.

- **Balancing Helpfulness with Withholding Solutions**  
  The AI is guided to identify bugs and suggest debugging strategies without supplying the fixed code, maintaining a productive learning process.

- **Supportive Tone**  
  Instructing the AI to use a positive and student-friendly tone helps reduce learner frustration and encourages continued effort.

## ü§ù Adapting to Learner Levels
- **For Beginners**  
  The AI should simplify explanations, addressing common beginner pitfalls like syntax, indentation, or type errors with accessible language.

- **For Advanced Learners**  
  The AI can provide more technical debugging advice such as profiling, use of debugging tools (`pdb`), unit testing, or algorithmic considerations.

## ‚úÖ Submission Checklist
- [x] Prompt is clear, specific, and well-structured  
- [x] Reasoning is thoughtful and well-articulated  
- [x] Addresses tone, guidance vs. solution balance, and adaptation to skill level

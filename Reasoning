1) What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

Answer : - 

Tone:

Friendly, encouraging, and patient.
Supportive rather than critical, fostering a positive learning environment.
Professional but approachable, avoiding jargon unless appropriate for the learner’s level.
Style:

Clear and concise explanations.
Use analogies or examples to clarify complex concepts.
Ask guiding questions to promote critical thinking rather than just giving answers.
Provide actionable next steps or hints rather than full solutions immediately.


2) How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

Answer:- Balancing Bug Identification and Student Guidance

Identify bugs clearly but gently:

Point out what’s not working or what might cause issues without blaming the student.
Use phrases like “This part might cause an error because...” or “One thing to check here is...”
Guide rather than fix:

Encourage the student to think through the problem by asking questions like “What do you expect this line to do?” or “Have you considered what happens if...?”
Provide hints or partial solutions that nudge the student toward discovering the fix themselves.
When appropriate, explain the underlying concept that relates to the bug.
Balance:

Start with guiding questions and hints.
If the student is stuck or requests it, provide more direct explanations or code snippets.
Always encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes.


3) How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?
Answer:- 
Adapting the Prompt for Beginner vs. Advanced Learners

For Beginners:

Use simpler language and avoid technical jargon.
Provide more context and background information.
Break down explanations into smaller, digestible steps.
Use more examples and analogies.
Be more explicit in guiding questions and hints.
Offer reassurance and celebrate small wins.
For Advanced Learners:

Use precise technical language and assume familiarity with core concepts.
Focus on deeper insights, optimization, or best practices.
Encourage exploration of alternative solutions or design patterns.
Challenge them with open-ended questions or edge cases.
Provide concise explanations and expect them to fill in some gaps.
Discuss trade-offs and implications of different approaches.
